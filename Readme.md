#Tractian Landing Page Project

I created this project only using HTML5 and CSS Flexbox for the design, all made by hand. We can see that i used many structures of the main website but refactored in my own vision of what is truly important on a Landing Page.

I made this focusing on numbers and functionalities to show to the company customers what will be improved and how it will be improved with your product.

I did this my way, because i'm still learning Javascript and i thought i could make a well designed and user experience focused Landing Page to represent the company, help to sell the product and generate more leads.

With my personal skills evolution i will go to add some interactions with Javascript to improve the page dynamism and make it more valuable to user experience.

I used the colors of the company as background of some sections to highlight and change the visibility, making all things plural and unique without changing the company identity, for the images i used some great images with such a high level of quality and still with the colours of the company. And with the idea to connect the whole world, what is even a little related to how your technoligies products works (connecting machines and indutry to your platform and devices).

On the first section of the site i chose to talk and show the part of your main site that is related to percentual averages of your products capabilities. On the second section i chose to talk and show to your customers the process of your services and how easy is to make everything working and ready to go.

On the third section of the Landing Page i chose to list and show the reasons why your customers should choose your products and services instead of another company or device, with a button at the end of it to give your visitors the opportunity to talk to a specialist and ask all their questions.

On the fourth section of the LP i chose to show some specifications and an image of each product to give some idea of how it is and its capabilities to your LP visitors.

On the another section i chose more numbers and characteristcs that made your product a better choice for indutry and clients.

On two final sections i chose to show the success cases of clients and a final form where the visitors could be in contact and ask for more informations or buy your products and services for their company.

This is a simple but good design, i didn't added the js that i was going to add because i'm still learning and running out of time now, but this design could be improved and is responsive made with CSS Flexbox and some Grid layout with hand made style.
